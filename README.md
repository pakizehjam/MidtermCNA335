# MidtermCNA335
  
   The Midterm project is about the population of the states.
   In this project, we should be working on a program that shows us the population of the states.
   Also, we should edit the population.
 
### First step:
  
  Create a database on PHPMyAdmin with zipcodes name. 
  The database should have zipcode and population columns.

  Creating the script of the zipcodes.py for uploading the data from a CSV file to the zipcodes database.
  
## Third step:
  
  Creating the script of the rest_web.py for searching the zipcodes and editing on that zipcodes database.
  
## Fourth step:
  
  Creating the script of the login.html for showing in the web browser for searching the zipcodes and editing on that zipcodes database.
